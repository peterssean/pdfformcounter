# PDF Form Field Analyzer

## Overview

This is a Streamlit web application that analyzes PDF documents to identify and count fillable form fields. The application allows users to upload PDF files and provides detailed information about the various types of interactive fields present in the document, including text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown lists, signature fields, and button fields.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit - chosen for rapid prototyping and simple deployment of data-focused web applications
- **Layout Design**: Multi-column layout using Streamlit's column system for better visual organization
- **User Interface**: File upload component with drag-and-drop functionality and real-time analysis display
- **Configuration**: Wide layout with collapsed sidebar for maximum content viewing area

### Backend Architecture
- **Core Processing**: Custom `PDFFormAnalyzer` class handles all PDF parsing and field extraction logic
- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF2 library for reading PDF structure and accessing form field metadata
- **Data Flow**: Synchronous processing where uploaded files are immediately analyzed and results displayed
- **Field Type Detection**: Mapping system that translates PDF field type codes to human-readable descriptions

### Data Processing
- **Input Handling**: Accepts PDF files as byte streams through Streamlit's file uploader
- **Field Extraction**: Analyzes PDF AcroForm structure to identify fillable fields
- **Output Format**: Structured dictionary containing field analysis results and metadata
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of PDFs without form fields or processing errors

### File Processing Strategy
- **In-Memory Processing**: PDF files are processed entirely in memory using BytesIO streams
- **No Persistent Storage**: Files are not saved to disk, ensuring privacy and reducing storage requirements
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Immediate processing and display of results upon file upload

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for creating the user interface and handling file uploads
- **PyPDF2**: PDF processing library for reading PDF structure and extracting form field information
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library for organizing and displaying analysis results
- **io**: Python standard library for handling byte streams and file-like objects

### Runtime Environment
- **Python**: Application built for Python runtime environment
- **Web Browser**: Client-side rendering through standard web browser interface
- **No Database**: Application operates without persistent data storage requirements
- **No External APIs**: Self-contained application with no third-party service dependencies
