# PDF Form Field Analyzer

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Streamlit web application that analyzes PDF documents to identify and count ALL fillable form fields using advanced detection algorithms. The application combines multiple detection methods (interactive widgets, advanced layout analysis, and visual pattern recognition) to achieve maximum accuracy in field detection. Users can upload PDF files and get detailed analysis showing field types, detection methods, and visual validation through color-coded overlays.

## Recent Changes (August 8, 2025)

- **Enhanced Field Detection**: Implemented advanced layout analysis that detects 192 fields on complex forms like Fidelity Transfer Authorization forms (vs. previous ~20-40 field detection)
- **Multiple Detection Methods**: Combined interactive widget detection, advanced layout analysis, and visual pattern recognition for comprehensive coverage
- **Improved Field Classification**: Fixed "Unknown Field" issue by enhancing widget type mapping - now properly classifies all fields as Text Field, Checkbox, Radio Button, Signature Field, etc.
- **Visual Field Overlays**: Added enhanced field visualization with color-coded highlighting and field type legends
- **Detection Quality Analysis**: Added detailed breakdown showing which detection methods found which fields
- **Accuracy Validation**: Successfully tested with both English and French Fidelity forms showing proper field breakdown

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit - chosen for rapid prototyping and simple deployment of data-focused web applications
- **Layout Design**: Multi-column layout using Streamlit's column system for better visual organization
- **User Interface**: File upload component with drag-and-drop functionality and real-time analysis display
- **Configuration**: Wide layout with collapsed sidebar for maximum content viewing area

### Backend Architecture
- **Core Processing**: Custom `PDFFormAnalyzer` class handles all PDF parsing and field extraction logic
- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF2 library for reading PDF structure and accessing form field metadata
- **Data Flow**: Synchronous processing where uploaded files are immediately analyzed and results displayed
- **Field Type Detection**: Mapping system that translates PDF field type codes to human-readable descriptions

### Data Processing
- **Input Handling**: Accepts PDF files as byte streams through Streamlit's file uploader
- **Field Extraction**: Analyzes PDF AcroForm structure to identify fillable fields
- **Output Format**: Structured dictionary containing field analysis results and metadata
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of PDFs without form fields or processing errors

### File Processing Strategy
- **In-Memory Processing**: PDF files are processed entirely in memory using BytesIO streams
- **No Persistent Storage**: Files are not saved to disk, ensuring privacy and reducing storage requirements
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Immediate processing and display of results upon file upload

## External Dependencies
